# Magic Moula

A final year computer science project. We were allowed to implement whatever we wanted however we wanted the only requirement was to use Python.
Our aim was to create a fake banking system, including account management, and transfers using a webapp that works on desktop and mobile

The frontend was built using React, Bootstrap and Vite, whilst the backend relies on MySQL, and Flask.
